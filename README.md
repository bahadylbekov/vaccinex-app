* Collaborative - Marketplace allows research groups share data with their partners worldwide for free by controlling access to that information using proxy re-encryption scheme provided by NuCypher.
* Distributed - The network is censorship-resistant and allows research teams share pre-encrypted genome data using IPFS without centralized cloud services.
* Decentralized - VaccineX is a blockchain agnostic project which gives users an ability pay for digital assets using Ethereum and Tezos crypto currencies.
